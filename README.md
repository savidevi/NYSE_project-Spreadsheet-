# NYSE_project-Spreadsheet
In this project I analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I am drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. I created a smaller subset of the data that I am using for the project.
### Background:
I used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.
### Skills I use
#### The main goal of this project is for to demonstrate my ability to:

-> Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
-> Use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).
-> Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
-> create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
